    <h1>Connectivity.me</h1>
    Visualising your spatial data in 3D!
</div>
<div class="container">
    When working with networks in a 3D space it can be hard to see how well a network looks in this 3D space. This is not only a problem when working on it yourself, but also during presentations. During a poster session it can be hard to show on a 2D image that your connected network is perfect. This is where connectivity.me comes in. Upload a file with all nodes, and a file with all connections between them to our site. Give a URL to viewers who can use their smartphone (including Google Cardboard) to view your network.

At Google I/O 2014 the google cardboard was introduced. With a cardboard box, two plastic lenses and a smartphone one can create their own 3D glasses. We added support for this cheap visualisation tool so everybody is able to look at the visualisations in three dimensions.

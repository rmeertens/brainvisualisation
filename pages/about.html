    When working with networks in a 3D space it can be hard to see how well a network looks in this 3D space. This is not only a problem when working on it yourself, but also during presentations. During a poster session it can be hard to show on a 2D image that your connected network is perfect. This is where connectivity.me comes in. Upload a file with all nodes, and a file with all connections between them to our site. Give a URL to viewers who can use their smartphone (including Google Cardboard) to view your network.

<h2>About me</h2>
My name is Roland Meertens. I am a researcher at the university of Delft adding artificial intelligence to drones. I love improving existing applications with artificial intelligence. My interests are Robotics, Human-Computer interaction and machine learning.
In this project he made the 3D visualisation in the browser, and added the effect so it could be used with a Google Cardboard.
